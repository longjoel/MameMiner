* [Documentation](https://github.com/longjoel/MameMiner/raw/master/Documentation/MameMinerDoc.pdf)
* These links will be revised as new versions are made available.

## Recent Changes

* 11/4/2015 - Updated documentation.
* 10/24/2015 - Added option to filter by good, working, and non-working games.
* 10/20/2015 - Added advanced search options.

## Mame Miner Use Cases

* You have an absolutely massive ammount of games, but only really want to find a hand full.
* You have absolutely no interest in filtering, filing, sorting, grouping, indexing, or cleaning. 
* You don't care about merged, unmerged, split, unsplit, parent roms, child roms.
* You just want games that will run.

## How Mame Miner Works

Mame Miner works by querying mame itself instead of querying the xml file mame can generate. That XML file can be over 100 MB
large and take a long time to parse. Mame's `-listfull` and `-listroms` command line options are very efficent. While the XML 
file generated by mame's `-listxml` contains significantly more data than the other commands, it contains data we are not 
interested in.

We are mostly concerned with the output of the `-listfull` and `-listroms` commands.

```
c:\Mame>mame64 -listfull pacman
Name:             Description:
pacman            "Pac-Man (Midway)"
```

```
c:\Mame>mame64 -listroms pacman
ROMs required for driver "pacman".

```

This gives us everything we need in order to build games that work well with mame.

The other part of the equation is to create a database of scanned roms using a sqlite database. This database contains one 
table with the following columns.

`Archive Path char(255) | Rom file name char(80) | Size long | CRC 32 long | SHA 1 char(40)`

While the process to scan your rom collection can take a significant ammount of time, Mame Miner does so in a way
that will not impede the rest of your system. Other rom organizing tools are written in such a way that all the processing 
happens in the UI thread, causing Windows to believe the program is in a non-responsive state.

When this table is built, making queries against it is very fast. This in a nut-shell is how the entire process works.

* 1 - Mame generates a list of games and game descriptions at start up.
* 2 - User searches for a specific game name based on the game descriptions generated in step 1.
* 3 - Mame Miner queries mame for list of roms based on the game selected in step 2.
* 4 - Mame Miner then queries the database for the roms stored in the zip files based on rom name, file size, crc32 and sha1
* 5 - Mame Miner attempts to generate a new zip file based on the results in step 4.
* 6 - If step 5 is successfull, place generated zip file in the mame rom directory.
