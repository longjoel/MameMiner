That XML file can be over 100 MB\r\nlarge and take a long time to parse. Mame's `-listfull` and `-listroms` command line options are very efficent. While the XML \r\nfile generated by mame's `-listxml` contains significantly more data than the other commands, it contains data we are not \r\ninterested in.\r\n\r\nWe are mostly concerned with the output of the `-listfull` and `-listroms` commands.\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:\\Mame>mame64 -listfull pacman\r\nName:             Description:\r\npacman            \"Pac-Man (Midway)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:\\Mame>mame64 -listroms pacman\r\nROMs required for driver \"pacman\".\r\nName                    Size Checksum\r\npacman.6e               4096 CRC(c1e6ab10) SHA1(e87e059c5be45753f7e9f33dff851f16d6751181)\r\npacman.6f               4096 CRC(1a6fb2d4) SHA1(674d3a7f00d8be5e38b1fdc208ebef5a92d38329)\r\npacman.6h               4096 CRC(bcdd1beb) SHA1(8e47e8c2c4d6117d174cdac150392042d3e0a881)\r\npacman.6j               4096 CRC(817d94e3) SHA1(d4a70d56bb01d27d094d73db8667ffb00ca69cb9)\r\npacman.5e               4096 CRC(0c944964) SHA1(06ef227747a440831c9a3a613b76693d52a2f0a9)\r\npacman.5f               4096 CRC(958fedf9) SHA1(4a937ac02216ea8c96477d4a15522070507fb599)\r\n82s123.7f                 32 CRC(2fc650bd) SHA1(8d0268dee78e47c712202b0ec4f1f51109b1f2a5)\r\n82s126.4a                256 CRC(3eb3a8e4) SHA1(19097b5f60d1030f8b82d9f1d3a241f93e5c75d6)\r\n82s126.1m                256 CRC(a9cc86bf) SHA1(bbcec0570aeceb582ff8238a4bc8546a23430081)\r\n82s126.3m                256 CRC(77245b66) SHA1(0c4d0bee858b97632411c440bea6948a74759746)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives us everything we need in order to build games that work well with mame.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the equation is to create a database of scanned roms using a sqlite database. This database contains one \r\ntable with the following columns.\r\n\r\n`Archive Path char(255) | Rom file name char(80) | Size long | CRC 32 long | SHA 1 char(40)`\r\n\r\nWhile the process to scan your rom collection can take a significant ammount of time, Mame Miner does so in a way\r\nthat will not impede the rest of your system. Other rom organizing tools are written in such a way that all the processing \r\nhappens in the UI thread, causing Windows to believe the program is in a non-responsive state.\r\n\r\nWhen this table is built, making queries against it is very fast. This in a nut-shell is how the entire process works.\r\n\r\n* 1 - Mame generates a list of games and game descriptions at start up.\r\n* 2 - User searches for a specific game name based on the game descriptions generated in step 1.\r\n* 3 - Mame Miner queries mame for list of roms based on the game selected in step 2.\r\n* 4 - Mame Miner then queries the database for the roms stored in the zip files based on rom name, file size, crc32 and sha1\r\n* 5 - Mame Miner attempts to generate a new zip file based on the results in step 4.\r\n* 6 - If step 5 is successfull, place generated zip file in the mame rom directory.\r\n\r\n## How to code for Mame Miner\r\n\r\nI really don't expect anybody to contribute to this, but if you have an interest in this project, send me a message first. \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Joel Longanecker\r\n\r\nThis software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.
